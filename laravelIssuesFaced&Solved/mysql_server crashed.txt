MySql and phpMyAdmin error fixed with these links help:

https://forum.laragon.org/topic/801/host-localhost-is-not-allowed-to-connect-to-this-mariadb-server/6
USE mysql;
CHECK TABLE user;
REPAIR TABLE user;

Or
https://superuser.com/questions/994903/126-incorrect-key-file-for-table-mysql-db-myi-try-to-repair-it
Exactly the same happened to me, I tried the following query and it worked:

USE mysql;
CHECK TABLE db;

If it returns db is corrupt, then repair it using

REPAIR TABLE db;
CHECK TABLE db;

You should get status as OK.

add this in the [mysqld] section: skip-grant-tables.
